I wanted to begin developing and writing down thoughts about things of practical interest to me, like career, dating, and mental health. If you're reading this, you probably know me :)

I don't intend this to be a blog about philosophy, arts, or religion, but these may come up inasmuch as they inform my perspectives on practical matters. I owe the title to Bukowski.
