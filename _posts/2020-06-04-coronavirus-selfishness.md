## Sins of Solidarity

Despite the provocative title of this post, I don't think what I have to say here should be too divisive. Perhaps it could even have the opposite effect. In my mind at least, these ideas don't fall under the political category (although everything has a political dimension).

A friend and I went out to a restaurant the other day. It was a couple weeks after they cautiously reopened in Ohio, and we had reserved a table on the patio. I had brought a mask to wear while we were being seated, but my friend had forgotten his. As we approached the entrance, it occurred to me that it could make my friend look bad if I were wearing a mask and he wasn't, so I decided to leave mine off in solidarity.

What interests me about this experience is the self-consciousness I felt interacting with the host and our waitress. They, of course, were wearing masks, which became an embodiment of the difference in our roles. I was there to be served, willingly taking the risk of exposure in order to enjoy the experience of dining out. The employees were there out of necessity, to some extent, taking greater risks and wearing masks all day to afford me this opportunity. It would only be fair for them to expect me to take the same simple precaution. Yet even if I had worn a mask initially, my role was going to require its removal at some point so that I could eat.

## Rationality and behavior

I think everyone has felt this self-consciousness at some point, particularly in moments when we feel like we may not have done due diligence to the cause of public health. I think it's important to realize that it's not all or nothing. Nearly everybody is doing *something* to protect themselves or others during this time. Nearly everybody *could* be doing more. I think this is part of why we feel self-conscious.

This prompts a rather loaded question: why are some people doing more or less than others? There are many ways to answer this, but let's assume that human beings are *rational* at some level. When it comes to how we act, there's a kind of calculation that occurs. Our minds weigh risks and compare different kinds of costs and benefits in what I think is a very nuanced and sophisticated way. We do it all the time and are often unaware of it. I was doing it at the restaurant when I weighed the benefit of wearing my mask against the cost of making my friend look bad.

It's possible I was wrong in my decision. This cognitive process-sophisticated as it is-is flawed. This is true from a moral standpoint as well as an epistemic one (like errors in arithmetic). Human reason sometimes makes a bad sum, resulting in behavior that doesn't accord with the real costs and benefits of a situation. And while there is something uniquely universal about the way rationality works, there are ways in which it varies for different people at different times. Something may be more important to me than it is to you (or it was to me yesterday), and that affects the calculus.

None of this is meant to imply that people are not responsible for their behavior. Given the complexity of our cognition though, we shouldn't be surprised to find that there are differences in the results of the calculations we perform. This is particularly true with something as unprecedented as this pandemic. Because there is no established "script" to follow, humans are having to rely more on reasoning. Our collective rationality is pioneering the way that script gets written in the future.

## Selfishness

As Gov. Mike DeWine recently tweeted, "this is a time in your life where your choices could mean life or death for others." I take this to be a simple fact, one that should form an important basis for how we decide to act during this crisis. Still, in the course of my daily calculations I'm aware of a certain finiteness to the weight that I assign public health concerns. In certain contexts (I will stop short of giving examples), they will be outweighed by other concerns I have. It's not that I don't "take it seriously." And though it can be difficult to visualize the people my actions are affecting, it's not really a problem of abstraction either...

As nice as it is to think of human life as unquantifiable, this is simply not a realistic description of how we think. *Everything* gets a quantity in the Calculation. Some quantities are prodigious, but nothing is categorically transcendent. What we have here is a lot of people assessing how much in their own lives they are willing to sacrifice for the public good. What magnitude of cost or benefit tips the scales? We shouldn't need to contrive a scenario involving trolley cars to show that there is a limit to everyone's willingness to sacrifice for others. I think we're talking about a kind of baseline human selfishness.

## Judgmentalism and denial

It's not my goal to normalize selfishness. Some would say that calling attention to it in this way is counterproductive. What cultural efforts there have been to emphasize unity during this time have seemed deliberate, and it is likely they have done some good. But I think they may have done harm as well, in the way well-intentioned mistruths sometimes can.

How do you persuade someone who is being selfish to change? It's a difficult thing to do. This is why our society is for the most part structured (viz. economically) to accommodate and even encourage selfishness. Generally, society defines "what's in it for me?" as a fair question to ask in almost any situation. No wonder it seems like some people are balking at this sudden requirement to inconvenience themselves for the sake of public health.

This is the reason for the redefinition. Since we can't rely on people to make good moral decisions, we have to resort to other means. Using media and other subtle cultural pressures, we must depict a casual lifestyle during the pandemic as something disproportionately reprehensible, bigoted. (Hence my self-consciousness for leaving my mask off at the restaurant, despite having an arguably good reason.) Through careful redefinition, selfish acts get met with judgmentalism and self-*less* acts with neutrality. It is not unlike a CEO declaring to her board of directors that profit growth is expected-and therefore a flat line is failure.

I'm concerned about the implications of pressuring people to behave morally. When virtue isn't chosen, it isn't real. Even if you manage to modify behavior, resentment and division is sown. It also makes it easier for people to entertain denial about the reality of the pandemic and the impact of their actions. I'm not the first person to observe this. Recently, I have seen messages from public health professionals (like Amy Acton) that seem more honest and less heavy handed, leveling with people and thanking them for their efforts. To the extent that selfishness *is* posing a threat to public health, I suspect that this is a better tack to take.

## Umwelt

Ultimately, however, I don't think selfishness really accounts for the diversity of lifestyle choices we've seen during this time. I doubt it's the primary factor differentiating how cautious people are and what risks they are willing to take. In my case, I'm fortunate to have a job that allows me to work from home. I know that that plays a part in reducing the people with whom I come into contact.

In the field of semiotics, there is the concept of **umwelt**. The idea is that organisms living in the same environment can actually live in separate *worlds*, due to differing perceptions and the meanings they assign to things. I think this is applicable here. Going back to my experience at the restaurant, I wager every aspect of it was different then that of the masked employees-so much so that we can be said to inhabit different worlds.

If there's one thing the pandemic has emphasized to me, it's that people live in these different worlds, seen in the different meanings we assign to coronavirus. One of the reasons coronavirus could mean *more* to someone is if there are not other concerns taking up mental energy. For some, coronavirus may be the only concern remotely close to life/death. For others, not so much. For some, waging the cultural war against the virus may even become functional and provide a kind of meaning. This doesn't have to be a bad thing, so long as there is self-awareness, which does not presume to be righteousness.

In conclusion, I think that we need to expect and allow for some level of diversity in pandemic behaviors. This is not to say that it doesn't matter. It's good to think carefully about your actions. You just can't necessarily apply your conclusions to others, as though the Calculation operates the same for them. You don't know what that person's world is like, the kinds of struggles they might be going through.

This is a time of barriers: cloth, plexiglass, six feet of air... Barriers inherently serve two functions: preventing *wild* things from getting in and preventing *tame* things from escaping. Now there are moral implications to being wild. Some are wild by choice. Others may have just happened to find themselves outside the borders when the walls went up. I don't expect others to understand what I mean by this. I live in my own world, after all...
