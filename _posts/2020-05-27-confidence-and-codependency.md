## An inquiry into values

I generally prefer journalling to blogging. Recently though I have found myself wanting to address certain ideas to my peers: thoughtful individuals living in our contemporary society. It's likely that I'll find a better audience in those with a certain willingness to challenge commonplace ways of thinking, as well an affinity for the past.

I want to talk about _values_, something which is admittedly anachronistic. In the words of Robert Pirsig, "I would not like to cut any new channels of consciousness but simply dig deeper into old ones that have become silted in with the debris of thoughts grown stale and platitudes too often repeated." That was in 1974, part of a plea for hippies to embrace rationality. If such an approach is even less popular now, it is all the more expedient. In a time of broadening, there is need to constrain and exclude. I want to limit the scope of thought until it becomes a focused beam. And because there is no better place to begin, I want to point that beam at the phenomenon of online dating.

## "I want someone who..."

Most of the dating apps today offer profile "prompts." One of the prompts available on one particular app is "I want someone who..." (allowing you to fill in the blank with whatever traits you are seeking in another person). I have sometimes wondered if these prompts are written by sociologists as a way to harvest data (which would be a great idea, don't get me wrong). Putting aside the question of whether prompts like this are effective in accomplishing the goals of the person who selects them, they obviously have a lot to say about what our culture values, particularly where there are emergent themes.

Unfortunately, we don't have access to query the data. However, I think it's fair to say that _confidence_ is among the more common traits requested in profiles (at least by women in their 20s, though I want to postpone making demographic distinctions here). I was not surprised to discover this, having often found it curious how much esteem there is for this particular trait. It is one toward which I have always been skeptical. I have sometimes wanted to retort with Woody Allen's aphorism: "confidence is what you have before you understand the problem."

## Confidence and assertiveness

In case we don't consider Woody Allen an authoritative source of wisdom, it's worth probing this a bit more. There is a related concept in psychology known as assertiveness, which is touted as an important social skill and even a component of mental health. The idea is that in social interactions people tend to operate between the poles of applying too much pressure (labeled aggressiveness) or too little (passivity). Assertiveness is that sweet spot in the middle, as it were, where you neither mistreat people nor allow them to walk all over you.

So far so good. Most will agree that both depicted extremes should be avoided. Beyond understanding it's in the middle, though, how do I know where this sweet spot is? How do I know in a given situation whether to apply more or less pressure to assert myself? To bring it back to dating, how do I know at what point a strong portrayal of myself and what I want will be seen as machismo?

What I find interesting about assertiveness is that it's defined primarily in terms of its consequences. As psychiatrist Fredric Neuman explains, "being assertive means behaving in a way that is most likely to achieve one's purpose." This gives it a peculiarly changeable aspect, since-aside from these purposes changing-different people are receptive towards different degrees of social pressure. It also means that acquiring assertiveness will require predictive insight into other minds to gauge probable reactions. Applied as a moral tenet, assertiveness is little more than "say whatever you need to" and has a distinctly manipulative vibe.

## Virtue ethics

Assertiveness, so conceived, aligns well with modern consequentialist ethics as a whole, where ethical action is seen as a matter of engineering particular outcomes. We can contrast it with the framework supplied by virtue ethics. When Aristotle describes virtue as a "mean between extremes," he has something different in mind than the precarious balance represented by assertiveness. The fact that courage is the virtue governing fear means that there is an appropriate level of fear, and that this metric hangs upon the nature of fear and human beings, objectively. It does not require a soldier to have predictive knowledge of warfare and whether the battle she finds herself in will be a victory or defeat.

Virtues are internal dispositions that naturally promote human flourishing. It is a feature of virtues that they don't depend upon other people or what happens to their possessor (thus was Socrates put to death for being the wisest in Athens). Is there a virtue that could pertain to social interactions and the kind of pressure to apply to get what you want? Would it look anything like assertiveness or confidence?

## Confidence and arrogance

Could confidence be a virtue? Unlike assertiveness, it seems to be an internal quality. So does it promote human flourishing? Well, yes and no... It does appear that confident people do better on dating apps, in the workplace, and with achieving their goals in general. The ability to accomplish goals is important to flourishing, I think. I don't feel the need to argue that the appearance of success is an invalid form of happiness in the general case (a point where I depart from many virtue ethicists). However, confident people can also be seen as arrogant. Arrogance is similar to confidence, except that its possessors tend to be disliked, which can actually be an impediment to success.

So what is it about confident people that causes them to succeed? When does confidence become arrogance and invite criticism instead? We can think of confidence as a way of comporting oneself based on one's value and ability. In this sense, it's possible to talk about the accuracy of this comportment, how well it corresponds with reality (or the beliefs of others, at the very least). Confidence becomes arrogance when a person's belief about himself is not commensurate with what others believe about his value and ability.

You might find it silly to talk about gauging human value like this (and you would be right). But I think this is what we're dealing with when it comes to confidence and its appeal. We are drawn to those whose value we see as higher relative to others, and confidence _can_ function as an indicator of this. But what actually makes a human being more valuable? More to the point, what is it that makes others see you that way?

## Social feedback

I submit that the difference between confidence and arrogance has less to do with internal disposition and more to do with what I call "social feedback." Suppose a young professional gets a job interview for a competitive position. She is as qualified as one can be just exiting school, and she is confident that she is the right person for the job. This confidence will help her in the interview, of course. Realistically though, there are many qualified applicants. Whether she gets the job will likely come down to the timing that her application was processed, or if she appears knowledgeable because the questions asked happen to align with her dissertation topic. Unfortunately, it may have to do with the scruples of the hiring manager and what she was wearing on that day. For one reason or another, success often has little to do with confidence, ability, or any other internal quality possessed by the person.

If this professional gets the job, her confidence will prove to have been well placed. If not, she will be forced to revise her self-assessment. Was it arrogant to think that she was the right person for the job? Ironically, this kind of self-doubt and introspection can create a more accurate self-image and prove beneficial to one's abilities. But that doesn't mean she will be confident in her next interview. She may be in for a series of disappointments and a concomitantly dwindling impression of self-worth. Arbitrary or no, the feedback from that first interview may prove to be a watershed moment for success or failure.

This phenomenon is not confined to the corporate world. Human identities and abilities are fluid enough that the feedback we receive from our experiences (particularly social feedback) can affect them powerfully. That feedback often affords or denies the opportunity to realize a given identity. Thus, the social response to self-assessment may well determine the accuracy of that assessment. This is the truth behind the clich√© that all it takes is to believe in people for them to succeed (though it is not true in every case).

But this is a somewhat unnatural state of affairs. The confident person who has been validated via society's enchantment with him is arguably out of touch with his true self and abilities. Apart from this validation, he is not disposed to succeed or flourish naturally. Selecting for confidence selects for privilege; its possessors are not so much worthy as lucky. Confidence is not a virtue.

## Codependency and meekness

If social feedback can cause human flourishing where it would not naturally occur, it makes sense that it could have an inverse effect to inhibit flourishing in those who cultivate virtue. Consider a different young professional, one who has grown up with the kind of self-doubt described above. Perhaps she once marveled how greatly the self is outnumbered by other persons in this world. For whatever reason, she is less confident. She doesn't know if she's the best person for the job. She may even think someone like a hiring manager, whose job it is to make this evaluation, is a better person to assess this than she herself.

Needless to say, this applicant is going to struggle in an interview. Even worse, she is likely to take rejection to heart, having in some sense invested this external agent with the authority to assess her value. When this submission is met with negative social feedback, it can exacerbate the need to receive positive feedback: from someone, anyone... Having submitted one's internal world for honest evaluation by the external world, it can be difficult to rescind that request.

"Codependency" is the word I've heard used to describe this unfortunate spiral. Awareness of the phenomenon of codependency may have led to an increased reluctance in our culture to endorse the perspective of this second young professional. However, I wonder if she can really be criticized. I wonder if her same attitude, under more natural circumstances, might actually promote human flourishing. Like arrogance and confidence, what differentiates codependent behaviors from their healthier variants is the way others respond to them. In other circumstances, we might laud the willingness of this applicant to assume a lesser status compared to others. "Another" would praise her and not her own mouth. Given more positive feedback, I think we would be talking about the virtue of _meekness_.

## Conclusion

My goal here is not to assign blame. The failure to recognize or reward virtue is a _systemic_ issue. I suppose I just want to assert what my values are, insofar as they differ from those of the system. To that end: I don't believe confidence is a virtue, despite its practical utility. I don't believe building confidence represents a wholesale solution to the problem of codependency. This would be to unlearn lessons that life has taught.

While codependency is a problem, meekness is still a virtue. I have respect for it when I come across it, not diminished by the fact it is highly impractical in the workplace and in dating. That said, it is not a trait that I myself try to imitate living in the modern world, nor would I advise others to do so. The costs are simply too high.
